# Food Truck Project

## Description of Project
This program allows the user to input up to 5 food trucks, including different characteristics about them. These include: the trucks name, the type of food, and a rating. The truck is also generated a unique, incrementing ID. After each truck input, the user has the option to continue to the next menu or enter a new truck. If the user accidentally inputs a new truck, they have the option to move to the next menu by typing "quit". After continuing to the next menu, the user has the option to display all the trucks with all of their fields, find the average rating of all the trucks, find the highest rated truck and display all of its fields, and the option to quit.

## What I learned
From this project I learned how to use many useful coding tools. One of the most important tools used in this project were arrays. The arrays allowed the program to store important information and also allowed efficient ways to use this data. The next important technique was using the fundamentals of object orientated programing(OOP). Through the combination of arrays and objects, the program was able to accomplish many of functions mentioned in the description of the project. Additionally, my understanding of coding fundamentals was further strengthened. I look to further expand my knowledge in OOP and using multidimensional arrays in future projects.
